1. Marketing Campaign

Steps:

1. First read the CSV and try to find whether you can able to do all the basics reading
activities
   1.1 find describe()
   1.2 find info()
   1.3 find shape()
   1.4 find dtypes()

2. Find the null data and drop the same.
    2.1 df.isnull()
    2.2 df.isnull().sum().sum()
    2.3 df.isnull().sum()

3. str.replace('[$]',',',)

4. Try doing GroupBY for Eduction Column, Country against other columns
   4.1 once done with grouping, visualize it with boxplot
   4.2 bar plot is categorical data against its value

5. Try utilize the visualization as much as possible

6. try see if you can able to do some outlier detection.(through program as well as through
visualization using box)

7. Try convert categorical data into numerical data

8. Try find corr() for Income against Education and apply this heatmap visualization.

Sample:

edu_meat_prod = df.groupby('Education')['MntMeatProducts'].sum()
edu_meat_prod = pd.DataFrame(edu_meat_prod)
edu_meat_prod = edu_meat_prod.sort_values('MntMeatProducts', ascending=0)
edu_meat_prod


Visulization:

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.countplot(x = 'Education',data=df)
plt.show()


output = df[' Income']
print(output)

columns = df.columns
print(columns)

['','','',' Income',''']
